# Alterian.AUTH.Model.SettingAppliesTo
How can you use these settings?             Please note that this it possible to combine these             For instance, for a setting which is available for both logins and sites, a value of 3 is used             For SAML Assertions, it would typically be 6 because they are applied at both the issuer and the login              Issuer settings don't actually have values associated with the issuer; the issuer settings are the assertions which are applied to the login             Values 1,2,3 will be what is returned when you populate a @see(LoginInfo)             Showing where the value for this login came from.
